    <B>Sir Isaac Newton</B> was an English polymath active as a <u> mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author</u>. Newton was a key figure in the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment that followed. His book Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in <b>1687</b>, achieved the first great unification in physics and established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician <b>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</b> for formulating infinitesimal calculus, though he developed calculus years before Leibniz. He contributed to and refined the scientific method, and his work is considered the most influential in bringing forth modern science.
    in the Principia, Newton formulated the <u>laws of motion and universal gravitation</u> that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint for centuries until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. He used his mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the Solar System's heliocentricity.
